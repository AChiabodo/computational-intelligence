### Notes

* Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management (use `poetry install` to recreate an environment with the versions specified in `poetry.lock`).
* A working [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) may be needed to use the enhanced graph layouts in [Networkx](https://networkx.org/).
